# IST - Marine Currents and Tidal Energy


This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts developed for the 'Marine Currents &amp; Tidal Energy' course offered at the Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Lisbon. These materials are designed to support both the theoretical and practical aspects of the course, which covers the modelling of tidal range and tidal stream energy conversion. They serve as an educational resource for students to explore and model scenarios, enhancing their understanding through interactive coding and data analysis.
