# IST - Marine Currents and Tidal Energy

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts developed for the *Marine Currents & Tidal Energy* course offered at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Lisbon, Portugal. These materials are designed to support both the theoretical and practical aspects of the course, focusing on the modeling of tidal range and tidal stream energy conversion. They provide an educational resource for students to model and explore scenarios, enhancing their understanding through interactive coding, data analysis, and computational modeling.
